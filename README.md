# BirdStrikeAnalysis
The spreadsheet contains
records of US flights between 2019-01-01 and 2021-12-31 where the plane has been struck by a bird
while in flight. 
Assume that you are the primary analyst/consultant in a project with Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA). Visualize the process that can help aviation authorities analyze the impact of 
bird strikes across different measures of intensity such as loss of human life, cost etc., and across 
different dimensions (e.g., location, time, etc.).
